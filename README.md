# website 

The idea behind this was to make it like a business card. Clean and minimal.


Currently working iterations of my portfolio website. Hyphens (-) infront of files denote experimentations and dropped page stylings. Still working on project display page, as well as the blog post for those projects and the about me. 

Need to work on VS code commits to git.
