        <div class="about"><p>HI! My name is Collin Kimball and I dream of becoming a programmer. <br><br>

            As a young teen, I taught myself HTML so I could alter my MySpace page to make sure the theme was right and it played the perfect song. After that, I began to program macros to better my experience when I played World of Warcraft. These scripts would do things like play different audio files and automate my character. With these small steps, I began my journey into coding. <br><br>
            
            However, during this time, I became enamored with the world of video editing and would later graduate with a bachelors in Compositing. However, even in the world of compositing, I was able to further explore different methods of coding. For example, I discovered that automation through coding with python was a far better solution to anything I could do manually. A random function here, an offset function there, whatever helped smooth the processes in Nuke, After Effects, and Maya. Whatever the program, I was putting python in it. <br><br>
            
            As I continued on in the world of film I soon found myself behind the camera and away from the computer. That, however, never felt right as it was missing something. In an attempt to rediscover what I loved, I began working as a technician, first for computers before branching out into my role at Disney. Every new step in this journey brought me back to the same realization I had all those years ago. I like solving problems and creating solutions. I love learning computer languages to either fix an issue or to simply create something new. <br> <br>
            
            With the support of my friends and family, I began spending all of my freetime teaching myself how to code. First was a foray into C#, followed by a brief refresher on html, before branching out into what was then the unknown for me. Through my self studies I’ve learned CSS, Javascript, PHP, MYSQL, and I’ve just recently begun venturing into C++. With these skills under my belt, I look forward to finally entering into the workforce and teaching others just how amazing the world of programming truly is. <br>
